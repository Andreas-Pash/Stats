# Stats
 
Welcome to the **Stats** repository! This project is dedicated to exploring a wide range of statistical concepts and techniques. Every day, a new Jupyter Notebook will be uploaded, delving into a specific topic within statistics, complete with explanations, visualizations, and code examples.

## Objectives

- Provide a structured and practical approach to learning statistics.
- Explore both foundational and advanced statistical concepts.
- Demonstrate the use of Python libraries like `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `statsmodels`, and `scipy`.
- Create a valuable resource for students, professionals, and enthusiasts who wish to deepen their understanding of statistics.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

```
ðŸ“‚ stats
â”œâ”€â”€ topic_name_1.ipynb
â”œâ”€â”€ topic_name_2.ipynb
â”‚ ...
â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“„ README.md
â””â”€â”€ ðŸ“„ requirements.txt
```

### Folders and Files

- `stats/`: Contains the daily Jupyter Notebooks.
- `README.md`: Provides an overview of the project.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists the Python dependencies for the project.

## Daily Notebooks

Each notebook follows a standard format:

1. **Introduction**: Brief overview of the topic.
2. **Theory**: Explanation of the statistical concept with formulas and key insights.
3. **Implementation**: Python code demonstrating the concept, often using real or simulated datasets.
4. **Visualization**: Graphs and charts to aid understanding.
5. **Conclusion**: Summary of findings and practical applications.
